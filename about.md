<strong>Question 1</strong>

You just had your first meeting with a client from El Salvador who is applying for asylum in the U.S.  Your client is applying <strong>affirmatively</strong> through an asylum officer at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security.  You have already researched the relevant statutes, regulations, and cases to assess the strength of his legal claim.  In addition, you would like to gather some data and statistics.

Source for Question 1:

Department of Homeland Security, “Immigration Data &amp; Statistics,” <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics">https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics</a>
<ol>
 	<li>a. How many affirmative applications were <u>filed</u> by people from El Salvador in 2016?  What percent of all affirmative applications do they account for?</li>
 	<li>.b. Have those numbers increased in the past few years?</li>
 	<li>.c. Among the affirmative application cases <u style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">completed</u><span style="font-size: 13px;"> in 2016, what was the outcome for those filed by people from El Salvador (granted, denied, etc.)?</span></li>
 	<li>.d. Does this information help you advise your client? If so, how?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Question 2</strong>

It is now a couple years later.  Unfortunately, the asylum officer did not grant your client asylum; instead, she referred your client’s case to an immigration judge (IJ).  Your client is now applying for asylum <strong>defensively</strong> in removal (deportation) proceedings in Immigration Court, which is part of the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review.
